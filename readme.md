What is Paybox?
-----------------

PAYBOX Services is a "multi-bank" Payment Service Provider to offer a comprehensive approach to processing payments from distance selling, providing a service linked to the whole banking landscape and non-bank card issuers. It's market player with connections to the various businesses, banks, card issuers, processing centres, institutions and integrators.

What is PlemiPayboxBundle?
-----------------

PlemiPayboxBundle is an interface to Paybox Services in order to use them really easily with Symfony2.

Requirements
------------

- [Paybox CGI](http://www1.paybox.com/telechargement_focus.aspx?cat=3)
- A knowledge of the Paybox Services docs
- Symfony2
- cURL (except if you want to use the shell way)

Installation
------------

- Add the bundle to your deps file or add it as a git submodule.
- Install CGI in "%kernel.root_dir%/app/Resources/cgi-bin/paybox.cgi"

Documentation
-------------

- 2 main classes : Request, Response
- Request is what you want to send to Paybox
- Response is what you get from Paybox

You can use request and response completely separately.

By default, you have to insert their CGIs in `%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/cgi-bin/paybox.cgi`
but you can change this path via config.yml (depends on your environment):

``` yaml
plemi_paybox:
    endpoint: %kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/paybox/cgi-bin/paybox.cgi
```

WARNING: your folder must be +ExecCGI on it if you use `curl` transport. Please, refer to Apache manual.

Usage
-----

### Request

``` php
$manager = $this->get('plemi_paybox.manager');
$request = $manager->createRequest();

$request->setTotal(100);
$request->setRank(34030);
$request->setSite(302);

return new Response($request->execute());
```

### Response

``` php
$manager  = $this->get('plemi_paybox.manager');
$response = $manager->createResponse($this->getRequest());

$amount = $response->getAmount();
```

Configuration
-------------

By default, bundle uses `shell` transport to talk with CGI module, you can switch it
with `transport` option:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
plemi_paybox:
    transport: curl
```

You can provide different path (url for `curl` transport) to cgi-bin with `endpoint`:

``` yaml
plemi_paybox:
    endpoint: http://example.com/cgi-bin/paybox.cgi
```

You can specify default request parameters with `datas` option. For example, in
`dev` environment, you will most likely want this:

``` yaml
# app/config/config_test.yml
plemi_paybox:
    datas:
        PBX_RANG:        99
        PBX_SITE:        1999888
        PBX_IDENTIFIANT: 2
        PBX_PAYBOX:      'https://preprod-tpeweb.paybox.com/cgi/MYchoix_pagepaiement.cgi'
        PBX_BACKUP1:     'https://preprod-tpeweb.paybox.com/cgi/MYchoix_pagepaiement.cgi'
        PBX_BACKUP2:     'https://preprod-tpeweb.paybox.com/cgi/MYchoix_pagepaiement.cgi'
```
